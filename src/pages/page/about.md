  Hey, I'm Brenden. Nice to meet you. Thanks for taking the time to check out my
  website. I hope you've enjoyed it so far.


  Quick fun fact. I don’t really consider myself a photographer. Don’t get me
  wrong, I take a lot of photos but I mainly focus on producing content.


  Currently, I take my talents to the publisher  Gear Patrol on a daily basis as
  their Platforms Producer, creating content for all of their digital media
  channels.
